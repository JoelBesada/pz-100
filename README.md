# PZ-100
Hello! Iâ€™m PZ-100, an NPM module built to evaluate human prospects through a set of puzzling challenges. Do you think you have what it takes?

## Developing Me
Use `babel-node` when running the unbuilt version:
```bash
$ ./node-modules/.bin/babel-node
> const pz100 = require('./')
```

## Building Me
```bash
$ npm run build
```
